### üîç Core SQL Analysis
```sql
-- Bike Share Profitability Analysis (MS SQL Server)
WITH combined_years AS (
  SELECT * FROM bike_share_yr_0
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM bike_share_yr_1
)

SELECT 
  FORMAT(dteday, 'yyyy-MM') AS month,
  rider_type,
  COUNT(riders) AS total_rides,
  SUM(price) AS total_revenue,
  SUM(price * riders) - SUM(COGS) AS net_profit,
  ROUND((SUM(price * riders) - SUM(COGS)) / SUM(price * riders), 2) * 100 AS profit_margin
FROM combined_years c
LEFT JOIN cost_table ct ON c.yr = ct.yr
GROUP BY FORMAT(dteday, 'yyyy-MM'), rider_type
ORDER BY month, profit_margin DESC;
